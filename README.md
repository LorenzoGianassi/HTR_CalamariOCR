# About the Project <a name="1"/>
The aim of this work is to replicate the training and testing  pipeline of a neural network about the problem of HTR. <br/>
This process is intended to demonstrate the efficiency of the Calamari OCR framework used for the model training and testing phases.<br/>
The training starts with the creation of the Ground Truth formed by segmented Text-lines in .png format and Transcriptions in associated text files. After the training of the neural network, the ability of the model in the HTR task is tested.

# Built with <a name="2"/>
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Calamari OCR](https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari)
# Getting Started <a name="3"/>
To run this program you need to install some specific libraries version required by Calamari OCR, install the framework and clone the git repo for src code.
### Prerequisites <a name="4"/>
The python 3.8.7 version of python3 is required to install Calamari OCR Framework.

Calamari requires a specific version of tensorflow to work with and some specific version of this python library, these are all the dependecies neded to work with Calamari OCR 2.0.1

- tensorflow = 2.3.2
- tfaip = 1.0.1
- h5py = 2.10.0
- numpy = 1.18.5

### Installation <a name="5"/>
To install the package without a virtual environment simply run:
```sh
pip install calamari_ocr
```

To install the package from its source, download the source code and run
```sh
python setup.py install
```
Then download all dependecies.
To download the source code check the [Calamari OCR](https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari) repo. <br/>
