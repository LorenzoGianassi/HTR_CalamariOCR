# About the Project <a name="1"/>
The aim of this work is to replicate the training and testing  pipeline of a neural network about the problem of HTR. <br/>
This process is intended to demonstrate the efficiency of the Calamari OCR framework used for the model training and testing phases.<br/>
The training starts with the creation of the Ground Truth formed by segmented Text-lines in .png format and Transcriptions in associated text files. After the training of the neural network, the ability of the model in the HTR task is tested.

# Built with <a name="2"/>
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Calamari OCR](https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari)
# Getting Started <a name="3"/>
To run this program you need to install some specific libraries version required by Calamari OCR, install the framework and clone the git repo for src code.
### Prerequisites <a name="4"/>
The python 3.8.7 version of python3 is required to install Calamari OCR Framework.

Calamari requires a specific version of tensorflow to work with and some specific version of this python library, these are all the dependecies neded to work with Calamari OCR 2.0.1

- tensorflow = 2.3.2
- tfaip = 1.0.1
- h5py = 2.10.0
- numpy = 1.18.5

### Installation <a name="5"/>
To install the package without a virtual environment simply run:
```sh
pip install calamari_ocr
```

To install the package from its source, download the source code and run
```sh
python setup.py install
```
Then download all dependecies.
To download the source code check the [Calamari OCR](https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari) repo. <br/>

### Usage <a name="6"/>
To create Ground Truth required by Calamari OCR you need to download from [IAM Database](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database) the datasets. Inside the datasets you will find the .png for each text lines of the document and the corresponding trascriptions in a xml file.  <br/>
To create the Ground Truth download src/ code and run the method in ```Parser.py ```. <br/>
After this run the the following lines from command line to compute the training, prediction and evaluate:
```sh
calamari-train --files your_images.*.png
```
Note, that calamari expects that each image file (.png) has a corresponding ground truth text file (.gt.txt) at the same location with the same base name. Required also by the evaluation step.
```sh
calamari-predict --checkpoint path_to_model.ckpt --files your_images.*.png
```
```sh
calamari-eval --gt *.gt.txt
```
Calamari OCR also presents the possibility of early stopping during training, providing a validation set. Many other training options can be found on the repo [Calamari OCR](https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari). <br/>
In the src/ directory you can find the following files:
- ```Parser.py ``` : Creates the g Truth and manages the files within it
- ```Utilities.py ``` : Utilities methods and creation of Confusion Matrix
- ```Lines_Detector.py ``` : Image preprocessing and simple line segmentation
